### Session Description
Max Words: 300 Briefly state the importance, relevance, value, and/or interest to higher education IT.

Come hear how teams at Penn State and Duke University, institutions sharing decentralized academic and IT cultures are building the future of learning technology. Fueled by open source technologies and standards, we're embracing users desire to choose their technology and pedagogy in a sustainable, supportable learning technology ecosystem.   

Critical elements for success: 
- embracing your university culture and building the right solution for it
- lean methodology in user experience design and development
- ecosystem level management of technologies, not just service level
- open technologies: web components, REST, Learning Tools Interoperability, Grouper


1 faculty decides to use technologyX, that's a scale of 1. it's a difficult choice for them as it means they have no support, but it is the best option for them and is sustainable for a time. On the first day of class, students are overwhelmed by the variety of tools and implementations in each of their courses.

when the faculty choose something different in 3 years, it's ok. They understand their needs and can manage the change (Is this the story, or is it...). When it's time for them to change in 3 years, they can't find the time or don't have the expertise to manage the change.

How can IT enable this type of environment, while providing a framework for support, ensuring data security and privacy, and all the while offering other competing solutions at the department, school, and university level?

high level discussion about how this is structured, ~~web components are minimally mentioned~~.
Holy crap, we can enable choice? We don't have to force users to use imperfect systems?

PSU starting at the content creation end. Duke starting at the student accessing content end. Faculty want to see what they can do in their courses. Students want to see what's going on in their courses. IT wants to run stable systems for the majority of users. Faculty and departments want to choose what technologies best fit their needs. 

Faculty don't just use their content in the context of their single course at your uni. Sometimes they adjunct at 4 different schools. Sometimes they give talks on the content. Sometimes they just want to share what they're passionate about on their website. Enable that, make it so easy for them to do what they want with what they create.

More technical or concepts, inspiration, vision?

### Session Track

### Session Outcomes
Max Words: 50 Your three session outcomes must clearly articulate what attendees will know or be able to do as a result of participating in the session. We encourage you to take some care in crafting these as these are important in the proposal evaluations. Outcomes must start with an action verb (i.e - understand, describe, identify, explain, etc.). Use the following format:

1. Explain differing interpretations of NGDLE and the role campus academic and IT culture plays in defining and realizing NGDLE.
2. How NGDLE can enable choice at the university, school, and faculty levels while providing a better experience for students.
3. How NGDLE can enable sustainable innovation at scale.


### Session Participant Engagement Strategies
Max Words: 300 Briefly describe the specific activities you will use to support active participation. Accepted proposals must include engaging content delivery and participant interaction. Presenters are encouraged to move beyond static PowerPoint slides, avoid "talking heads" to more interactive discussion and innovative ways for participants to learn from one another and contribute shared knowledge.
