### Session Description
Max Words: 300 Briefly state the importance, relevance, value, and/or interest to higher education IT.

Come hear how teams at Penn State and Duke University, institutions sharing decentralized academic and IT cultures are building the future of learning technology. Fueled by open source technologies and standards, we're embracing users desire to choose their technology and pedagogy in a sustainable, supportable learning technology ecosystem.   

Critical elements for success with similar initiatives: 
- embracing your university culture and building the right solution for it
- lean methodology in user experience design and development
- ecosystem level management of technologies, not just service level
- open technologies: web components, REST, Learning Tools Interoperability, Grouper


We all have those faculty who decide to use new, shiny technologyX. It can often be a poor and difficult choice for them as it means they have no support, but it is the best option for them and is sustainable for a time as it is a scale of 1. 

Bryan/Lauren, what narrative is where this should go?

1. When the faculty choose something different in 3 years, it's ok. They understand their needs and can manage the change. 
1. When it's time for them to change in 3 years, they can't find the time or don't have the expertise to manage the change.

For students, it's a different story. They have 4-6 faculty all doing something different and are overwhelmed by the variety of tools and implementations in each of their courses.

How can IT embrace faculty choice, while providing a framework for support, ensuring data security and privacy, and all the while offering other competing solutions at the department, school, and university level?

This reality exists on both of our campuses. PSU is trying to solve it from the content creation end, Duke starting at the student access content end. Faculty want to see what they can do in their courses. Students want to see what's going on in their courses. IT wants to run stable systems for the majority of users. Faculty and departments want to choose what technologies best fit their needs. 

Faculty don't just use their content in the context of their single course at your uni. Sometimes they adjunct at 4 different schools. Sometimes they give talks on the content. Sometimes they just want to share what they're passionate about on their website. Enable that, make it so easy for them to do what they want with what they create.

### Session Track
* **Exploring Innovation in Teaching and Learning**
* Creating a Culture of Data-Informed Decision Making
* **Leading and Partnering Across the Institution**
* **Evolving Infrastructure and Enterprise IT**
* Managing and Reducing Information Technology Risk
* Transforming the Student Experience

### Session Outcomes
Max Words: 50 Your three session outcomes must clearly articulate what attendees will know or be able to do as a result of participating in the session. We encourage you to take some care in crafting these as these are important in the proposal evaluations. Outcomes must start with an action verb (i.e - understand, describe, identify, explain, etc.). Use the following format:

1. Explain differing interpretations of NGDLE and the role campus academic and IT culture plays in defining and realizing NGDLE.
2. How NGDLE can enable choice at the university, school, and faculty levels while providing a better experience for students.
3. How NGDLE can enable sustainable innovation at scale.


### Session Participant Engagement Strategies
Max Words: 300 Briefly describe the specific activities you will use to support active participation. Accepted proposals must include engaging content delivery and participant interaction. Presenters are encouraged to move beyond static PowerPoint slides, avoid "talking heads" to more interactive discussion and innovative ways for participants to learn from one another and contribute shared knowledge.

The last 20 minutes of the session will be entirely discussion-based. We will lead a discussion where attendees can share how they are interpreting and applying NGDLE concepts at their schools and what local contexts are most important for accomplishing NGDLE projects. 

Q&A on our projects will be accepted but we hope to steer the conversation towards the similarities and differences between school's interpretation and application of NGDLE concepts as well as the relationships and partnerships needed to bring NGDLE into practice at a university.

If the conference has a particular active learning or participation vendor of choice, we would be happy to explore how they could be leveraged in my session.

### Diversity and Inclusion Content
Max Words: 100 EDUCAUSE values diversity in perspective, opinion and representation. Our program committee strives to develop a program that represents our diverse community. How does your proposal reflect or address diversity and inclusion?

We use, create, and share open source, free, and universal design. These pillars are core to our groups and allow more people to benefit from our work and participate.

What we are trying to build allows users to choose the tech that works for their brain, needs, classroom, students, content to be learned. We want everyone to be able to get the information they need, when they need it, how they need it. That is inclusive technology for learning.


### Lead Presenter Qualifications
Max Words: 100 Provide a brief bio for the lead presenter covering the scope of professional responsibilities, expertise on the topic, and previous experience presenting or facilitating sessions in the selected conference format.
